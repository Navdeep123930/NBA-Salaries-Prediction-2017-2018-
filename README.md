# NBA-Salaries-Prediction-2017-2018

In this repository I built NBA Salaries Prediction Model.It can help the managers and coaches  of all 30 teams to find a player who have ability to put their teams to another level within their budgets.
 The model was built based on multiple features such as NBA_DraftNumber, Age,WS(Win Share),BPM(Box Plus/Minus).
 
I used an architecture based on two Dense layers,both with 4 neurons and ReLU activation function. A dense layer with a linear activation function used as output layer.
The model was fit with both features and labels, for a total amount of 70 epochs, separating 25% of the samples as validation set.

I applied various Python tools to get a better visual understanding of the data.

This project uses the following software and libraries:

Python

Tensorflow

Keras

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn etc...

Thank You
