# NBA-Salaries-Prediction-2017-2018

In this repository I built NBA Salaries Prediction Model.It can help the managers and coaches to find a player who have ability to put their teams to another level within their budgets
 The model was built based on multiple features such as NBA_DraftNumber, Age,WS(Win Share),BPM(Box Plus/Minus).
 
I adopted an architecture based on two Dense layers,both with 4 neurons and both using a ReLU activation function. A dense layer with a linear activation will be used as output layer.
The model was train with both our features and their labels, for a total amount of 70 epochs, separating 25% of the samples as validation set.I used mean squared error loss function to know if our model is learning properly or not.

I applied various Python tools to get a better visual understanding of the data.

This project uses the following software and libraries:

Python

Tensorflow

Keras

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn etc...

Thank You
